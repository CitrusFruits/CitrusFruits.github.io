For those of you who don't know, I'm in Europe. My flight left yesterday, September 2nd at 7:30pm, and I'm now sitting in an airport in Stockholm waiting for a layover. Don't worry, I know what you all want. You don't want to sit there and read the every detail of my entire journey. You want all the interesting stuff, and you want pictures. Well I got you covered; I'm here to deliver. But first, I'm going to take care of some business, the questions everyone has been asking.

I'm traveling with my friends Bryan Boersma, Luke Butler, and Ben Leung. Bryan has been and is one of my best friends since 4th grade. Luke is my notorious "Croatian friend" who is actually the son of American missionaries to Croatia. Still, he qualifies as a Croatian since he was born and raised there. He has slept on the floor of my room for roughly a grand total of a year. Not consecutively of course. And Ben is my friend that I met in college. He's basically the reason I started playing Basketball, and a super cool dude. For those of you who want to know, this is our rough itenerary.

- Bergen, Norway
- Oslo, Norway
- Stockholm, Sweden
- Copenhagen, Denmark
- Berlin, Germany
- Prague, Czech Republic
- Vienne, Austria
- Venice, Italy
- Bern, Switzerland
- Brussels, Belgium
- Amsterdam, Netherlands

Of course we wont be following this to a T, and I'm planning on visiting London but we still have to figure out transportation for that. Oh, and I've been up for a grand total of 23 hours so far, but I'm shooting to stay up till we get to our hotel and roughly 22:00 Norway time, roughly 29 hours without sleep. Sounds pretty doable to me. Picture time!

The Stockholm airport. A little smaller than Oakland Int'l but with a whole lot more light pine hardwood floor.
