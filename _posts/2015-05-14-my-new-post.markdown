Oh, Oslo. I'm not really sure how to adequately describe it, but I'll start with this.

It's expensive.

Like really expensive. Apparently it's been elected the most expensive city in the world on 3 different occasions. That would have been some key information to know before we decided to stay there for 4 days. I knew that Norway was among the most expensive nations in the world, but I didn't know that it was the most expensive. And here we were, in the capital city. It wasn't really a  disaster, but needless to say, everything we did in Oslo was brightly colored by this fact.

Roughly six or so days before our train to Oslo, while I was still at home, I emailed my 15 year old 3rd or 4th cousin whom I've never met, Christina, who happens to live an hour or so away from Oslo. I told her that we were visiting Oslo soon and asked her if she had any suggestions on what we could do. I got her response while we were actually on the train into Oslo and she didn't disappoint. She suggested about seven different museums and a laser tag place. Among those suggestions, was a viking museum.

Now it turns out the viking museum was actually a viking ship museum, and at that a very small viking ship museum. But it was still pretty cool; the largest collection of viking ships on earth. We went to the museum on our first full day in Oslo, and it was roughly 5km from our ho(s)tel in an area of Oslo that used to be the king's manor which was turned into a city park upon his decree. We walked there. It's looking like were going to be doing a lot of walking this trip since all of us are way to cheap to pony up for a bus pass. Speaking of money again, it was outside the viking museum at a convenience store that I paid $15 for a mediocre burger with some overly salted fries.

The next day we did laundry. It was raining cats and dogs, and none of us had umbrellas. Cost to do laundry: $16. I believe that's about quintuple the amount it costs stateside. After laundry was finished, we went to a kebab place. I've never had a kebab before, and it was fantastic. For those of you who don't know, it's basically a pita bread sliced in half and stuffed with lettuce, cucumber, corn, and bad quality meat along with some mystery sauce. They're also extremely cheap. Luke says it's like the fast food of Europe, and kebabs are from the Middle East. Besides the kebab we also went to the National Culture Historic museum or something like that. Our tickets for the viking museum were also good there for 48 hours, and we we're pretty determined to get as much value for our money as possible. The Historic museum was surprisingly large compared to the tiny viking ship museum, and had a lot of, not so surprisingly, objects from Norway's history. I thought the swords were fascinating; I've been a psuedo fan of Norwegian blades for a little while now. In addition to Norway's history, they also had some Egyptian, Thai, and Sami artifacts. I'm pretty sure the Sami people are like the Eskimos of Norway, but I'm also probably being pretty ignorant and offensive to say the least.

For the last day, we went to the sculpture garden. The sculptures at the center of the garden were pretty interesting; I think it was some sort of collection on families. Basically a bunch of naked statues. I did my best to appreciate them for what they were, but beyond that I can't really comment. The rest of the park wasn't really my cup of tea. We tried to milk as much time out of it as possible though. After that we decided to go to the fortress on the other side of town, but not before stopping by the kebab place again. On our way to the fortress we encountered a pretty large, impressive looking building with a bunch of Chinese people walking around taking pictures. According to Ben, wherever there's good art, so too are there Chinese tourists. The building ended up being the Oslo town hall, and had some absolutely phenomenal murals on the walls inside. Additionally, outside there were these really cool wood carvings that related Norse mythology. We got to the fortress and it was neat for what it was, but in the end it was a fortress.

Today we left for Stockholm, but not before making one last visit to the kebab place. It hasn't gotten old, not yet. I'm sitting on the train as a write. I won't be able to post this until tomorrow though since the train doesn't have free internet. The scenery isn't anywhere near as breathtaking as the last train ride, but it's still nice; mostly flat and forested with some open plains.

It's also worth noting that I've read two books since I've come to Europe; the Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins and Compelled by Love by Heidi Baker. I don't know if this is going to be a trend, or just a result of the fact that we had a lot of free time and not a lot of money to spend in Oslo.
