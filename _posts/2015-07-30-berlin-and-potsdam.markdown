I got to this one a bit late, and I think there's probably a lot of reason for that. It's actually our second night in Prague here but I'll be writing about Berlin and Potsdam. Honestly, I think the reason why I haven't really written until now is because I had a really bad time in Berlin. I mean, there were definitely a lot of moments in which I was really enjoying myself, enjoying my company, and enjoying the city. But being in Berlin kinda cultivated a minor sense of despair in me.

I'll try to elaborate on this for a bit before I move on to tell you about the fun things. But I also want to address that I believe it's very important to not only write about the good, but the bad as well. For my sake, it helps me ground myself. I have a great life, but I never want to trick myself into thinking that things are better than they are. A fabricated view of reality is incredibly unhealthy. I try to be real, but I also look for redeeming factors in all situation; I look at the bright side without forgetting the dark is still there. Also, for my audience reading this, whether you're my friend, family, or just some random person who happened to miraculously stumble upon my travel blog, I want to do my best to share some struggles so that I can ground your view of me in the real world. It's really easy to look at what someone chooses to share with you online and think "Wow, they're life is amazing. I'm so jealous." It's going to sound like me just venting my frustration, but I'm actually trying to give an accurate perspective of my time in Berlin.

We rolled into Berlin an hour after our train was scheduled to because we apparently took the slow train instead of the fast one. So we got there at like 8:30pm after the sun had set and we didn't know how late the hostel desk was open until. We spent about half an hour sending Ben off to Potsdam to hang out with David, and then started walking to our hostel based upon directions from a tourist info center. Despite the simple directions we got lost and wandered for roughly 45 minutes. We got on the correct street, and started walking down it to get to Chausestrasse 102 (strasse means street). The numbers we were seeing were like 32, 33, 35 etc. We got all the way to the end of the street, and the numbers stopped at 55 or something like that. After about another 20 minutes of confusion, we discovered that the street numbers actually start at 105 on one side and 33 on the other at the beginning of the street, and one counts down as the other counts up until the meet in the middle. Or another way to explain it would be that the numbers are always counting up, just when they get to the end of the street, they cross the street and keep counting up but in going the opposite direction. Also, Chasestrasse doesn't end with a dead end, it discretely turns into another street. Basically, the whole street is set up in the most idiotic way possible; the dumbest system in the world. It turns out our hostel was really close to the beginning of Chausestrasse on the opposite side we were walking, but it was really far from the curb and slightly hidden from view. We got up to the hostel, on the 5th floor, and the receptionist informed us that we needed to pay a 5 euro deposit for a key. By pure luck, or more likely God's grace, I had exactly one 5 euro note on me.

This hostel, despite having good reviews and being clean, was by far the worst we stayed at. You had to deposit 5 euro for every room key and an additional 5 euro for every locker key that you wanted. Additionally, all the beds creaked an unbelievable amount. I adjusted something on my phone while laying down and the bed creaked. Not kidding. Finally, the most frustrating thing, was the WiFi. Now, I'm not someone who can't survive without Internet for a couple days or anything like that, but this WiFi was a whole different case. You had to get a different code to log onto it every 24 hours. Additionally, even with this code, the WiFi would either stop working, slow down incredibly, or kick your device off once every 10-40 minutes. This was so amazingly frustrating that it literally put me in a bad mood for my entire stay in Berlin. I would have been happier if they didn't have WiFi. It would cut out at the worst times; when I was checking for directions, when I was emailing my parents, or when I was trying to buy bus tickets for our entire group to travel to Prague.

O yeah, and Berlin smells terrible.

Switching gears to a different note, I'll talk a little about the Zoo. We all went to the zoo, and the zoo was fantastic. The Berlin zoo is one of the largest in Europe, and had just about all the animals you could ever want. They had jaguars, hippos, bears, gorillas, rhinos, boars, and about 4 million other creatures. I think everyone there really enjoyed themselves. Fun fact: the German word for hippo translates literally into "water horse." Those things are like small tanks that can swim. Quite scary.

The day after we were joined by David Heller, a friend of mine and Ben who lives outside of Berlin. Ben and I met David last year when David did a year abroad and studied at UCSC. He's a super cool dude and is traveling with us in Prague. David isn't really a Berlin native by any means, but he joined us in the city and pointed out some things we definitely would have missed. We visited Checkpoint Charlie and a section of the old Berlin Wall. I wasn't really in the mood to fully appreciate it though.

The following day we got to spend some time in Potsdam, the town where David currently lives. David showed us around Potsdam, which is a nice small town and reportedly is more representative of Germany than Berlin is. However, Potsdam is still a big deal since it used to be the capital of the Prussian empire and consequently contains six or so palaces. Additionally, it has a giant park in the center which contains a beautiful small church on the side of a pond. This park actually used to be the gardens for the largest palace in Potsdam. Potsdam had plenty of bakeries, very few cars, and a slower pace than most the cities we've been to which led me to appreciate Potsdam a lot more than Berlin.

If you made it this far into this disorganized novel of a blog post, I'll treat you with a little story. It took place the night after David first visited us. We we're all hanging out at the lounge of the hostel, and I was fed up with the internet and feeling really irritable so I went for a walk. It was probably around 9:30. I walked to a bakery we'd seen the day before, but it was closed; I guess I was just hoping. I had a feeling of slight self abandonment and planned on getting lost a bit but just ended up at a kebab place 3 blocks away from our hostel drowning my sorrows in food. After eating out of depression, I made my way back to the hostel. I got back around 10:15, and decided just to sit in the lobby. Also in the lobby, were two girls who I could have sworn sounded like they were from California. Turns out they're proud twenty three year old Canadians from the great city of Toronto. One sounded like a real sorority/valley girl type while the other spoke more intelligently and less often. Anyways, they were really loud and started complaining about how no one wanted to go out that night. One of them slowly turned to me. "Do you want to go out?"

Me: "Uh... I'm good."

Needless to say (or else we wouldn't have a story), within five minutes they convinced me, or I convinced myself to go out. Actually, now that I recall, the reasons that I said yes were (1) because they looked like they needed a guy to go with them and probably weren't going to be able to go unless they found one, or a large enough group of additional girls and (2) I figured it might be an adventure. Let me be clear, I wasn't flirting with these girls in the slightest nor did I for the rest of the night. We actually ended up adding two more guys to our group, one who rolled a cigarette every six minutes and another who was a pretty talented guitar player.

So, these girls took me out. I informed them that I don't go out often, and they immediately assumed that I knew nothing of the world and took a slightly condescending posture when interacting with me. At that point I really didn't care, I was just kindof at their mercy and along for the ride. Their plan was to go to a club that had progressive techno music with some big name djs or something like that. Two subway connections later and we arrived at the club, except it didn't open up until midnight. So we went to some Indian restaurant to hang out for the hour or so. I got a beer, some people got cocktails. We ended up leaving the restaurant around 12:20, headed over to the club, and lo and behold, there is a four hundred person line. We stand in the line for about 10 minutes, during which the cigarette rolling member of our party tries to buy some sort of drug. Shortly after the girls decided that we should abandon the line, and the cigarette roller thankfully leaves our party. We then went in search of another club, and ended up in this small one room bar with very strange pictures on the walls. Everyone gets another beer, decide it's lame, and we leave. Finally, the girls decide they want to get into one of the bigger clubs, so we pick the first one we find. Sadly, we had to pay a 5 euro entry fee. We get in and discover it's a hip hop club, which I don't really mind cause I'm not picky and they were playing more old school stuff which isn't too bad. After using the bathrooms and dancing in there for about 10 minutes, the girls decided that it was too late and the club was kinda terrible (which it was), and we left.

I got back to the hostel at around 3am, more tired than anything else. I took a shower, climbed into bed, and woke a bunch of people up with my creaking bed.

This was probably my first experience ever going to a proper "club." I'm hoping these clubs were just bad examples for the rest of their kind, because they were pretty boring. And in case you were wondering, the dancing at InterVarsity dance parties is waaaaaaaaaay better. Like 10 times better.


I'll write to ya'll again soon.
