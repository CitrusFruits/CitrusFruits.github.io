Innsbruck, let me tell you a bit about Innsbruck.

First of all, I don't really know how anyone really hears of Innsbruck. Apparently it's the capital city of the Austrian federal state of Tyrol. Also, apparently Austria has states. Who knew. Additionally, Innsbruck has hosted the Winter Olympic Games twice in 1964 and 1976. It is one of only three cities to have ever done this along with St. Moriz, Switzerland (1928, 1948) and Lake Placid, USA (1932, 1980). So I guess there is quite a lot of reason to hear about Innsbruck, but for someone in my generation though, it was pretty much pure luck that I found out about it. The city doesn't really do too much to give its importance away either. The only noticeable remnant of the Olympic games was a giant ski jump facility on a hill next to the city.

Bryan and I decided we didn't want to go to Italy at all since it would generally be more expensive, more difficult to get around, and neither of us were to stoked about Milan. So, we took it upon ourselves to find some more obscure town or attraction in western Austria, and we just happened to stumble upon the longest alpine coaster in the world located in Mieders. For those of you who don't know, an alpine coaster is a single seat roller coaster on a monorail located at a ski resort. There are other ones besides the one in Mieders, but they really aren't that common. There was no affordable lodging in Mieders, so we decided to stay in Innsbruck since it wasn't too far out. Luke decided to visit his friend in Milan instead.

While the town of Innsbruck itself is rather unremarkable, the scenery around it is pretty astounding. Innsbruck is in a valley between two mountain ranges, each with peaks rising more than 5,000 feet above the town itself. When we got there, no more snow was left on the peaks, which was good new in my mind. I pointed to a peak at one point and told Bryan "We're going up that one." He thought I was joking.

The first day there we climbed up the mountain I pointed at. We both were equipped with just fuzzy duds and day packs but I wasn't worried. It took roughly three hours to get up to the lodge just below the peaks. Bryan stayed at the lodge since he was pretty tired, but I continued up to the peak; I was too close not to. It took me about another half hour to get all the way up, and I was rewarded with one of the best views I've ever had. On the other side of the peak was a whole array of mountains, each as high as the one I was on, with no roads or structures to speak of. The sides of the mountains were all scored diagonally by glaciers, I think. I really wish I could have taken a picture, but my phone broke so I had no camera. Any pictures in this post will be ones that Bryan took, but he wasn't with me at that point. I climbed back down, met Bryan up again, and we worked our way back to our hostel. The whole endeavor took about nine hours, which included two hours of walking across town on the way to and back from the trail.

The next day Bryan and I made our way into Mieders on some very expensive buses to get to the Alpine coaster. We took a gondola up to the top and hung out there for a while. Our legs were pretty much toast so we didn't do too much hiking, although we managed walk around for a hour or so and hike up to the top of a hill where some trees had been clear cut. The top of that hill had some amazing views. We made our way back and set off on the coaster.

I have to admit, I was pretty hyped for the coaster. I saw the video of it online, then stopped it a quarter of the way through because I didn't want any of it spoiled for me. I was planning on going down the whole thing without braking at all (the cart has a brake lever). Unfortunately, this fantasy was ruined by some elderly woman in front of me going down it at a crawling speed. I had given her a three minute head start but I still caught up to her less than half way down. O well, the coaster was still fun. He'res the original video right here, not filmed by me though.

That's all I really have for now.
