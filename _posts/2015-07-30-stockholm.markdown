So we were in Stockholm. I was in Stockholm. It was cool, I guess.

Please excuse the cheesy posed picture. I wanted some sort of pictorial recording of the fact that I was in Stockholm, and it's kinda hard to take candid pictures of myself, so this had to do. 

Stockholm, first of all, was a big step up from Oslo. Not only in atmosphere, but also with our housing arrangements. In Oslo, we were basically all cooped up in a room with just four beds and a sink in it. I was beginning to think that I was getting a bit of cabin fever. However, in Stockholm we stayed at the "City Backpacker's Hostel" which turned out to actually be really awesome. The beds were comfortable, there was a good amount of common space to hang out in, the WiFi was free, and they had a kitchen with systems in place to make sure everyone's food was properly labeled and separated. Also they had free (uncooked) pasta.

The food situation in Stockholm ended up being better, mostly just because we had our own kitchen. We (Luke mostly) made bolognese twice and a pasta sauce of chicken with bell peppers and onions the third night. A big step up from the bread and cheese in Oslo. Additionally, eating out was less than Oslo, but just barely. Unfortunately, we only had kebabs once.

During our stay in Stockholm we really did only two things of real note. Well maybe three. The first is that we went to the Nobel Prize museum because, evidently, the man who fathered the organization that gives out the medals every year was from Stockholm. Alfred Nobel was the man, the inventor of dynamite or "Merchant of War" as he disparingly found out he was called. He actually was a peaceful guy who wanted to change this world for the better. As he passed through his elder years he changed his will to ensure that a foundation that encourages, congratulates, and drives progress in this world would be founded. All that being said, the museum was pretty lackluster. It was mostly just pictures with words underneath, nothing that really merited an exhibit. The items that they did have ranged from IV bags to a Samsung Galaxy S4 to some nobel prize winner's slippers. Not exactly riveting.

The second thing of note is that we all went to a place called Skanson. Skanson is an "open air museum." Essentially, it's a collection of old Swedish buildings relocated for my viewing pleasure. Additionally they have a children's zoo, and a real zoo. The real zoo only had animals from the Scandinavian region, which was something the very small part of me who is conflicted about zoos appreciated. This being the case, they had wolves, owls, otters, seals, moose, reindeer, bears, bison, and boars. But, the children's zoo had something even better: guinea pigs. The guinea pigs, which in case you didn't know don't really exist out in the wild any more than a domesticated dog does, were in this fairly large pen with grass and bushes and everything. They were super adorable. We probably spent a good ten minutes just watching them nibble on grass.

The third, semi notable thing, was that I paid over $10 for a pretty poor quality beer at a bar. It was called "pistolskull" or something weird like that. I only got it because we were going out and that particular tap said that its beer was from Sweden. Sweden had one chance to impress me with their bears and really let me down. I guess it is also worth noting that Stockholm is a very picturesque city. They way the pastel painted buildings catch the setting sun is quite nice. But, at the same time, there's some really ugly buildings in between which throws me off; there doesn't really seem to be a proper balance. And then there's like a thousand McDonalds, 7-11s, and Burger Kings which make me feel like I'm back in America again.

I'm slowly coming upon the realization that maybe I just don't really like hanging out in cities all day. Or maybe I just don't like being in a city and not being able to consistently afford good food, especially when that food is all around me. It also could be that I don't know what I'm doing in each city, I'm just there with no agenda. The only question I have to the answer "Why am I here?" is "Because it's a city in Europe." Up until this point in my life I've pretty much always had something that I was driving towards daily, but at the moment I don't quite have that. For the time being I've taken any extra time I've had and spent most of it trying to prepare myself for when I return home; even though it's a long way off. I feel like I should be ready for the next events in my life; I don't want to passively accept whatever comes my way.
Tell your friends!
