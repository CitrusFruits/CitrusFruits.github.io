It took me a couple hours on the train today to decide if I actually wanted to make this blog post. But in the end, I decided I like Copenhagen and want to remember it well.

Copenhagen is a city of bikes; it's like one giant Stanford campus. That was super evident as soon as we came out of the train station.  Bikes outnumber cars significantly; there's 2 bikes per person in Copenhagen. This number is probably aided by the fact that the city is pancake flat. In addition to all the bikes, Copenhagen seems to be a very fit city. There are a lot of people out and about running and exercising. Reportedly, there's even a tax on saturated fats. No kidding.

The other big thing that I noticed was that basically all the buildings in Copenhagen are made out of bricks. At first it looked really industrial to me, but then I realized how much I liked it. Copenhagen felt so much less pretentious than Stockholm or Oslo although I don't really know why. Perhaps it's because I had no expectations rolling in and Copenhagen threw something unique back at me. Also, for those of you who know what Team Fortress 2 is, this city really reminded me of the buildings in the maps. Very cool, minimalist non modern architecture.

Our first day there we took a free tour that ended up being around 3 hours long. Our guide was pretty cool, a young Danish woman who grew up in the Stockholm area. Although her English was definitely fluent, she kept on stressing syllables at weird places in a sentence. We visited a lot of places relevant to Hans Christian Anderson, the town halls, the places the first and second great fires of Copenhagen took place, and the royal palace. Apparently after two great fires that cumulatively burned 90% of the city down they decided to rebuild their buildings the fantastically non-combustible material brick. I'm not complaining. Oh, we also saw the little mermaid statue which stares longingly into the sea waiting for her lover. 

He aint coming.

On the second day, we went to the national museum which was 100% free. I was super stoked about the free part. A little side note: British people don't know about the word Stoked. The museum was actually quite good, it had a pretty comprehensive history of Denmark from roughly 100,000 BC all the way up to the end of the Iron Age. That being said, I could have sworn that every single room in that place had a display case full of stone axe heads. They would all read something along the lines of "In the middle years of The Bronze Age, stone tools still had a significant role in society." Give me a break.

My tolerance for museums is starting to run a little thin. This museum also tried to establish Denmark's stake in the ever present war of the Scandinavians for trying to claim the Viking society as their own. Additionally that day we went to The Round Tower. It's a tower in the center of Copenhagen that doesn't really have stairs, just a spiraling roundabout up to the top. Up there you have a sweeping three hundred and sixty degree view of Copenhagen. It was quite nice. Finally, that day we had lunch at an all you can eat Greek Buffet, which was absolutely fantastic. There was salad (my first vegetables in weeks), pineapples, oranges, pasta salad, chicken, beef, meatballs, tzatziki, lasagna, and a bunch of other stuff. They also had some sort of custard cake which I think I had three servings of.

I'm still on the train through Germany heading to Berlin as I write this, and I'd like to make some sort of note how the countryside is different than in California. Maybe not so much on a small scale, but overall it's a lot flatter and a lot greener. The hills are more like bumps, and there's a ton of forest patches around even though there's no mountains. I hadn't really ever thought about it before, but in California there's only really forests in the mountains. It's different in Germany, and Sweden for that matter.
