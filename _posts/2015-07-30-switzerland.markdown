Oh, Switzerland. How great were you.


Switzerland was probably the best experience for me since Bergen/Trolltunga. Inssbruck was pretty close too, and a nice mountain town, but Isseltwald and Interlaken were on a whole new level. Let me start out with giving you a little background though.

The original itinerary for our trip had us going to Bern, the capital of Switzerland. We more or less penciled this in because we didn't really know what the good cities in Switzerland were, and at the time it was too much effort to research every country in detail, especially knowing that we wanted our plans to be flexible. So, when we started getting closer to our Switzerland dates we researched the different cities we thought looked nice and ended up choosing between Lucerne and Interlaken. Interlaken won out since it had two lakes, and Lucerne only had one. Interlaken is situated on a roughly 5 mile strip of land boxed in by lakes on the east and west borders, and mountains on the north and south. That being said, we actually spent our first three nights in the Interlaken area in a small, small town called Isseltwald which was on the southern side of the lake east of Interlaken. But that's enough geography.

Isseltwald is most likely the smallest establishment we've stayed in yet. I might even venture to say that it's smaller than Kinsvarik, the town we stayed in on an a fjord in Norway. And like Kinsvarik, Isseltwald is surrounded by some of the most fantastic scenery I've ever seen. The hostel we stayed at was lakefront property, and our private room, which had a balcony, had a sweeping view of the lake. Any time of the day it looked beautiful. Even at night you could go out onto the balcony and see the lights of the houses around the lake reflected upon the still water of the lake that is shielded by the mountains that surround it.

Our first day in Isseltwald we rented some kayaks and went onto the lake. It was relaxing. Luke and I also cooked some stew that was would have been absolutetly amazing if we hadn't burnt it. Neither of us knew before this that you could burn stew, so we also learned something that day. The second day in Isseltwald, we went for a hike on the trail that was quite literally a three minute walk from our hostel. This trail took us up 5000 ft to the ridge of the surrounding mountains, which was spectacular. The trail actually kept going and would have taken us to a variety of different locations in the surround area, including Grindelwald, but we were a little short on time. When we arrived at the top, there was a cottage with a "S.K.I" flag and a man outside playing the accordion. We sat opposite the trail to it in a shelter.


Luke closed his eyes as he listened to the sweet melody of the accordion play. It reminded him of something, but he wasn't quite sure what. Wait, yes that was it. It reminded him of Ben's angelic singing voice. Oh, how he longed to hear that voice again and how he missed Ben's presence beside him. It had only been a little more than a week that they had been separated, but it felt like an eternity. Luke had tried to contact Ben again, but to no avail; he was starting to get worried. He was worried that Ben's didn't see their friendship the same way he did. Ben still hadn't even paid him back for the meal he cooked in his honor for their last night together in Vienna. Was it a sign? Did it mean that their friendship was over? No, Luke wouldn't harbor these thoughts; speculation had never helped him in the past. Luke decided to just enjoy the moment and let the honeyed tones of the Swiss accordian carry him through the mountaintops.

The day after our hike we switched locations, from Isseltwald to Interlaken. Our Interlaken hostel was not nearly as nice or accommodating, but at least it wasn't the worst we've been to. They didn't really let us check in when we arrived a bit early, so Bryan, Luke, and I went for a walk, leaving our luggage behind at the hostel. Our walk took us past some apple orchards, corn fields, and cow pastures that all sit just on the edge of town; a rather cool feature. We eventually made our way to the western lake which looked just about as spectacular as the eastern one, although it wasn't quite the right time of day to fully appreciate it.

The next day Luke and I took a train up to Grindelwald; Bryan declined to go. Grindelwald is a little town that my parents told me about, and at first I thought we weren't going to be able to afford it. However, upon further inspection I found out that it only cost about $20 for a round trip ticket from Interlaken to Grindelwald. I decided that this was likely a once in a lifetime chance, and I really wanted to take advantage of the opportunity. Luke and I did a roughly 6 hour long hike, round trip, to the top of the ridge on the western side of Grindelwald. This hike, once again, had amazing views. The hike goes along a route that skirts the face of a 15,000 ft tall mountain that is absolutely massive in all respects. That, along with the view of Grindelwald in the valley below, created a very nice hike. At the top we had Snickers and a lunch of bread and cheese.


That's all for now!

Oh, and a big thanks to Luke Butler for providing the pictures for this post.
