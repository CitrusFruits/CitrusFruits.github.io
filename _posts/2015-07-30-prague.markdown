"What's a Prague?"

-Luke Butler, September 27, 2014

So far, Prague has been the best city; it's beautiful. The shear amount of old architecture, cobblestone, and street vendors makes Prague quite desirable. Add in the vast amount of street vendors and cheap food and Prague becomes one of the most desirable tourist destinations. I'm pretty sure I wasn't the only one who thought this, since Prague was also the most crowded city we visited. At least it deserved the crowd, more so than Stockholm I might would venture.

Probably the most notable thing for me, about Prague, was the cathedral. Prague has the biggest castle in Europe, although it doesn't really look like what you would imagine for a castle, and the centerpiece of that castle is the cathedral. I didn't really pay attention to what it was called, who built it, why, or how old it was. Basically I know nothing about it except that it was really huge, and really beautiful. The stained glass windows inside had some of the best colors I'd ever seen. We got to see the light shine through the window and hit a painting on one of the walls, and I gotta say it looked pretty nice. Each of the stained glass windows were probably 30 or so feet high, with the highest point of the ceiling of the main sanctuary being probably around 100 feet tall. The spires outside most likely went up 150 feet. I could be wildly off, but just try to imagine a cathedral so big that you feel like a toy soldier in a regular sized house.

Another notable thing was our hostel. Unlike some of our previous hostels, this one was pretty nice. Very nice, fancy even. The ground was marble, along with all the counter tops. They had red carpets running down the stairs, the wood for the beds was a nice deep brown, they had free WiFi and free breakfast. And, it only cost $19 a night, which is insanely cheap.

The food in Prague was some of the best we've had so far as well. This is most likely because we could actually afford food there, but it was good nonetheless. We found a restaurant, that was pretty obscure so you probably haven't heard of it, that was super affordable. It was possible to get an appetizer, main course, and drink for under $10. And this was all nice food, not fast food or anything like that. We went there three times in total, and each time I got the same thing: potato dumplings stuffed with ham, topped with crispy onions on top of a bunch of sweet sauerkraut. Pretty awesome.

I guess something else that I should mention is that Prague actually has it's own mini Eifel Tower. I'm not sure what the official name of it is, but apparently it was built in the same year as the real deal as some sort of partnership or whatnot. It's roughly 1/3rd the size of the real Eifel Tower, and probably 90% less impressive since it's up on a hill, out of view, and no one really cares about it. Also you had to pay four bucks to go up it which we weren't about to do.

Skipping to a completely different note, it seems like there's a whole lot more apple trees in Europe than in California. We saw a bunch in Norway, I've seen some in Germany, and they've been everywhere in the Czech Republic and Austria, which we're traveling through on train at the moment. This is something that for some reason is nostalgic for me, even though I don't think my family has ever owned an apple tree. I think my parents might have taken me and my siblings to an apple orchard once when we were much younger, and it was enough to leave an impression on me. Nevertheless, I took the first opportunity I could in Prague to climb an apple tree. You gotta get way up there because the best stuff is always at the top. I climbed the tree, tossed a couple apples down to Ben and Luke, and then started climbing down. On my way down though, a branch went up my nose a good 3 inches. Apparently apple tree branches grow straight up because there was roughly 50 of them like it and it was apparently an inevitability. Still, it was a painful experience that left my sinuses a little wounded for a good couple hours.

I'd like to make a note how even though Prague has been the most beautiful city we've visited in Europe, it really doesn't hold a candle to Trolltunga or the fjords of Norway. Prague even paled in comparison today to the rolling hills and forests of southern Czech and northern Austria. I'm really thankful that I have this opportunity to visit all these cities, but I really wish I could go so the mountains more.
