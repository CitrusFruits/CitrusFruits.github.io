Hey everyone, checking in here from the train somewhere beteween Bergen and Oslo. You know, I was thinking about something I said in my first blog post; that I know what you all want and I'm going to deliver. Well, I may not deliver, and here's why.
I don't want to be thinking about all the stuff I can put on my blog while I'm out seeing all these crazy sights. I don't want to be thinking about what I'm doing next, I want to be thining about what I'm doing now. I'm not traveling to entertain the three people that will end up seeing this. I'm not traveling so that my friends and family back home can hear me rattle on about the places I've gone. I'm not even traveling for my family, as much as I admire them. I'm traveling for myself, so that I can see something new, and maybe even have a better understanding and appreciation for the world as a whole because of it.

That being said, I do think that a blog like this presents an amazing opportunity for me to document my trips and process everything I'm seeing and doing. It just so happens that I can do this in a public manner, and I think it's kindof fun to do so. If you enjoy hearing about what I'm doing then that's even better. Here's what's up.
We landed in Bergen pretty late and took a $15 bus ride from the airport to our hotel for the night. Our room was on the 4th floor. We decided to go find something to eat, and surprisingly found a 7-11. According to Luke Butler, he's never seen a 7-11 in Europe. Well, in Bergen alone I saw 9, and Bergen is a pretty small city. Anyways, that first night we slept at the hotel, then took the $15 bus back to the airport to pick up our favorite Croatian, along with the rental car we had booked. We picked up the car and the Luke, and set off for Kinsvarik, or something like that. All the cities here have ridiculous names. Kinsvarik is roughly a 2.5 hour drive from the Flesland airport where we were. We had uploaded a .pdf of directions to Bryans phone since we don't have any data plans out here. Or rather we do, it's just $18/mb.
As per the directions we went through 5 roundabouts and took the exit to the E39 highway. Or at least that's what we thought. Turns out the directions said go through 5 roundabouts, *then* take E39 highway. Long story short, E39 south helped us tak a 2.5 hour tour of area south of Bergen. In our lostness we passed the same horses 6 times, and wasted a lot of gas, and developed a pretty healthy distrust of directions from people at gas stations.. We also succeeded in making Bryan deathly ill from car sickness. We figured it out eventually though, because we're brilliant. The drive to Kinsvarik was beautiful. Stunning. That reminds me, I'm getting caught up in the details.

Norway is gorgeuous guys, absolutely fantastic. The boys and I hiked up to Trolltunga (the whole reason why we drove out to Kinsvarik), and it looks like something out of the Lord of the Rings, except *more dramatic*. This was the most beautiful scenery I've seen in my life, and I like to think I've seen some amazing scenery before. Earlier on the train ride today I was looking out the window thinking "This must be what Heaven looks like." I'm being melodramatic about this, but I don't care. Everything here is lush green. There's streams flowing everywhere, the air is clear, and the fjords and lakes have water so still you can see the reflections of the entire mountains and forests that line them.
Friends, Luke and I ate whaleburgers. They cost $23. Norway is expensive. Until next time...
